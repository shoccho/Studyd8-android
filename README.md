# Studyd8
An app that allows students to find other students to study with based on their college and the classes they are taking  
# Core Functionality:

  Create a profile with personal info + school + classes you are taking + major + year in school + prefered study habits 
  
  Browse profiles of other users at the same school as you, see shared classes (filter by school then by classes taking, sort by class code )
  
  Message users to coordinate studying (do we need an invite/accept system, or can we just let people message others immediately? (and allow blocking of people who they didn't want to message)) tag for actively seeking study partners
